# FaceRecognition
- Simply run the "RollCallSystem.py" file and ensure that the required objects for importing in other PY files have been installed prior to execution. These objects include "face_recognition," "cv2," "pyttsx3," "tensorflow," and "matplotlib.pyplot."

- The "TrainingData.pkl" file contains training data for myself and my 32 classmates. If you wish to include additional data, execute "RollCallSystem.py" and respond with "1" when prompted with "U wanna add a new one?" (To decline, input "0"). Follow by entering the ID and name to add a new face for recognition.

在運行之前先看看其他PY檔中需要import的物件是否已經install ,
